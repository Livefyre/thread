# Thread

A Thread of Content consists of a root Content and its direct descendent Content.

```
Root Content
|_ 1st Child content
|_ â€¦
|_ Nth Child content
```

A nested Thread can be achieved by adding another Thread as a child.

```
Root Content (1st-level Thread)
|
Root Content (1st-level Thread)
|_ Root Content (2nd-level Thread)
   |_ 1st Child content
   |_ â€¦
   |_ Nth Child content
```
